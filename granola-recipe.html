    <p>
      All my life i have hated, i repeat: hated Granola, And honestly breakfast cereal as a whole too.But this changed
      completely when i met a friend of mind in mogadishu.A bit of well thought of <em>carefully prepared Granola</em> changed this.
      So i have been having this every day for a week now. Whenever I need breakfast, whenever I crave dessert. 
      I put some yogurt in a bowl, that granola on top, some banana and some almond butter.

    <h2>History of Granola</h2>
    <p>Granola has been the most ignored,if i can least say about it,cerial in many people's breakfast menu.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 cup oats</li>
      <li>1 tsp coconut oil</li>
      <li>1 tsp cinnamonr</li>
      <li>1/3 cup sliced almonds</li>
      <li>2 Tbsp sunflower seeds</li>
      <li>1 Tbsp flax seeds</li>
      <li>2 Tbsp honey (or maple syrup)</li>
      <li>2 Tbsp shredded coconut</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Mix all ingredients very well in a bowl.</li>
      <li>Toast this mixture in a non-stick pan on the stove at medium heat, stirring consistently for <strong>3-5 minutes.</strong></li>
      <li>Let the granola cool off and serve with fruit and yogurt/milk of choice!.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>To make it chunkier:</strong>use 1/2 oats and add a bit more honey (about 1/2 tbsp). Once the mixture is heated, it will caramelize and form clusters.</li>
      <li><strong>Gluten-free option:</strong>use gluten-free oats</li>
      <li><strong>Vegan option:</strong>use maple syrup instead of honey</li>
      <li><strong>Paleo option:</strong>don't add oats, use some more sunflower seeds and almonds instead.</li>
    </ol>
